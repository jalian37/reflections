When you initialize a repository, the content of current directory can be managed by git. 
Hidden folder .git is created, where all commits and changes are stored. But the commit history is empty
until you commit the files.
List of chnaged files, or yet not commited can be viewed using git status command

staging area defines what files should be included in a commit. it must not contain all files in a working directory. i can remove files from staging area, but not from a repository, i think.
