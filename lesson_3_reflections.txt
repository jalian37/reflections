When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When I want to work on multiple computers and share the files, or more commonly, when there are more people collaborating
on the same files.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because not all my commits are suitable for public and more importantly, i would have to be always online 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
branches are different versions within one repository. clones are different versions of repositories either on github or locally
forks are a special type of colnes, existing only on github. advantage of forks is they remember its original repository and you can suggest changes to the original repository
